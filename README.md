# Retail Diagnostics

This is a simple C# .NET GUI application that can be used as a "nothing to see here, doing legit things" Red Team tool that can then run a .NET assembly as a malicious payload.

Nothing too complicated. Most useful in social engineering exercises. Re-skin the UI to suit your purpose.
